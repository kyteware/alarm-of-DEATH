# Angry Alarm

## Inspiration
Everybody knows someone that takes forever to wake up. This tool solves that.

## What it does
Angry Alarm (name pending) is an AI agent "Wakey," determined to get you awake through any means necessary. While other alarms are confined to their device to wake you up, Wakey has many weapons at their disposal. Depending on how long it takes you to wake up, Wakey will execute a variety of actions including, but not limited to:
* Pushing objects off your table
* Sending your search history to your friends
* Leaking your API key
Don’t make Wakey angry, or face the consequences!

## How we built it
We used a variety of different API integrations including Gemini API, HTTP API, Chrome Extension APIs, along with Arduino interaction and Python as a centralized hub to manage the AI agent and activate set actions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This project was modular in construction. As a result, each of us could work on individual tools that the AI agent would use. This allowed our group to work efficiently, with each person always having something to work on and never waiting on anybody else.

## Challenges we ran into
Although modular construction allowed our team to constantly make progress towards a final product, the most time-consuming portion was bringing everything together for Wakey’s use. We all used different methods to implement our work, requiring extensive time to standardize each module.

## What we learned
Almost everything we created in this project included a new API or integration that we had never previously used. As a result, we were able to create something our group had never made before, and learned a lot along the way. Additionally, we learned about the power of AI-assisted programming as a use for both debugging and repetitive code generation.

## What's next for Angry Alarm
If we were given more time to work on Angry Alarm, we would make Angry Alarm more appealing in appearance and add more features. Some features we workshopped include deleting files, flipping the mattress you’re resting on, and electrocution.
